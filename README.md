# World-Happiness-Report
World Happiness Report is the report that ranks countries on the basis of how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be.
The purpose of this project is to analyze the seven factors – Happiness score, GDP Per Capita, Social Life, Health life expectancy, freedom, Government Trust and generosity that contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the seven factors.
